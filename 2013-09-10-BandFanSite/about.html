      <h3>Band Members:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>David St. Hubbins</li>
          <blockquote>"I believe virtually everything I read, and I think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything."</blockquote>
        <li>Nigel Tufnel</li>
          <blockquote>"You can't really dust for vomit."</blockquote>
        <li>Derek Smalls</li>
          <blockquote>"We're very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries, David and Nigel, they're like poets, like Shelley and Byron. They're two distinct types of visionaries, it's like fire and ice, basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water."</blockquote>
