              <h2>Computer Mail Gaining a Market</h2>
              <h3>by John Markoff on <date> December 26, 1989 </date></h3>
              <p>Electronic mail, which has taken a secondary position to the facsimile machine through the personal computer boom of the 1980's, is finally coming into its own.</p>
              <p>Electronic mail, known as e-mail, allows users of personal computers or computer terminals to exchange typed messages or electronically stored documents. But to use electronic mail, personal computer users have had to master complex software programs and addressing schemes and subscribe to more than one mail service, which is expensive and inconvenient. In contrast, a fax user needs only a piece of paper to transmit and a phone number.</p>
              <p>Indeed, some computer experts have argued that as long as computers are not widespread enough or simple enough to offer a universal communications system, facsimile machines will remain the dominant means of electronic communication for business. Brighter Future Seen</p>
              <p>But now that is changing. The nation's hodgepodge of electronic mail systems are increasingly being hooked together. And, capitalizing on the rising speed of desktop computers, a range of new applications will arrive next year to extend the versatility of computer communications. It will be possible, for example, to append spoken voice notes to standard text messages and documents. And commercial services are exploring selling data in response to electronic mail requests.</p>
              <p>Companies that have switched to electronic mail say the systems speed communications by avoiding telephone tag and ''flatten'' organizations by permitting anyone to communicate regardless of rank. Advocates of electronic mail cite studies showing that it encourages workers at different levels of a company to communicate informally, cutting through layers of corporate bureaucracy, more than does the telephone or paper mail. A middle-level manager is more likely to send a message to the chief executive over the computer than to telephone or place a note in the office mail.</p>
              <p>As a result, in many corporations electronic mail is becoming a significant alternative to the fax machine, the telephone and to what electronic mail advocates like to call snail mail, or paper mail.</p>
              <p>''The growth in computer mail systems within companies is just exploding,'' said Eric Arnum, editor of Electronic Mail and Micro Systems, a computer industry newsletter based in Forest Hills, Queens.</p>
              <p>That growth is certain to accelerate in the early 1990's, computer experts say. Linking Systems</p>
              <p>Electronic mail systems available to the general public but used mostly by businesses - like Western Union's Easylink, U S Sprint's Telemail, MCI Mail and A.T.& T. Mail - have recently dropped their initial resistance to connecting to one another through electronic gateways. And private, intracompany electronic mail is flourishing, spawned by a growing recognition that computerized mail systems that permit transferring everything from brief messages to entire documents can transform the way a company works.</p>
              <p>On the horizon is a new generation of electronic mail software applications that are seen as the best candidates for creating the kind of desktop computer boom brought by the spreadsheet in the 1980's.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, for example, the Lotus Development Corporation, based in Cambridge, Mass., introduced a program called Notes that is intended to expand the function of electronic mail. Notes permits users to categorize and view all of their computerized documents and messages by specific criteria that can be easily changed. Notes, which is being marketed to large corporations with hundreds or thousands of employees, also permits workers at widely separate locations to undertake a project by sharing documents.</p>
              <p>The Notes program is an example of a new software category called ''groupware.'' It runs on local networks and can be used to transmit particular pieces of information to particular groups. For example, Reuters Information Services is developing a Notes application that will disseminate news to personal computers on a network and allow each user to organize and view it in the most convenient way.</p>
              <p>''If you look at traditional electronic mail it really falls short,'' said Brownell Chalstrom, Lotus's director of telecommunications and networking. ''People typically use mail for short things. We offer more structured communications.'' Sound and Graphics</p>
              <p>Most major computer companies, including the International Business Machines Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company are racing to develop what are being called compound-document or unified-messaging architectures. Such designs will permit users of powerful desktop computers and work stations to send and receive messages that blend video, speech, graphics and text. Both I.B.M. and Digital have new products with these features - Office Vision and All-In-One, respectively - that will be shipped next year for users of both large and small computers.</p>
              <p>Next Inc., a maker of computer work stations, also offers as a standard feature the ability to add voice comments and graphics to any text message. Steven P. Jobs, who founded Next after leaving Apple Computer Inc., calls the blending of computer networks, electronic mail, fax and voice mail ''interpersonal computing.''</p>
              <p>''In the 1990's, personal computing will transform personal communication roughly by the same magnitude that, in the 1980's, spreadsheets transformed business analysis and desktop publishing,'' he said.</p>
              <p>The figures for the growth in the use of electronic mail are already striking. The number of installed publicly accessible electronic mailboxes in the United States grew to 1.8 million from 210,000 between 1980 and 1989, while the number of in-house computer mail systems jumped to 6.8 million from 220,000.</p>
              <p>One small company benefiting from the rise of private corporate mail systems is Soft Switch Inc., a Wayne, Pa., developer of electronic-mail software that connects corporate mail systems. I.B.M. announced last week that it is dropping an internally developed system and adopting Soft Switch's software for I.B.M.'s computers.</p>
              <p>Yet despite more than a decade of high expectations, winning wide acceptance for electronic mail services has not been easy. This year, for example, the big companies offering publicly available electronic mail opened their systems to connect with their competitors only grudgingly, after pressure from the Aerospace Industries Association to make the changes or lose business.</p>
              <p>''The big issue in electronic mail until we got into the act was you could talk to anyone on MCI Mail, or whoever your vendor was, but God help you if you had to talk to anyone else,'' said Steven York, a Hughes Aircraft executive who heads the electronic mail committee of the aerospace association, which represents more than 50 of the nation's largest aerospace companies and more than 600,000 high-technology employees.</p>
              <p>Electronic mail companies now use an internationally agreed upon set of software protocols, known as X.400, that allows different mail systems to exchange and direct messages correctly.</p>
              <p>With the announcement earlier this month that A.T.& T Mail and MCI Mail, two of the nation's largest electronic mail services, will connect with an X.400 link, it is now possible for a computer user to send computer-generated messages to and receive them from various commercial services from a single mailbox. Military Industry Needs</p>
              <p>More than any other industry in the United States, military aerospace companies are related by a web of subcontracts and joint projects that require workers at different companies to stay in touch with one another.Work groups may span geographic and company boundaries. In these situations, electronic mail can play an important role.</p>
              <p>The impact of electronic mail extends beyond the aerospace industry. In large and small offices throughout the country, it is being seized on as a means of communication more efficient than the telephone. An electronic mail message can avoid the familiar business problem of interminable telephone messages when both parties are busy. Advocates say electronic mail messages can more effectively deliver information than a telephone call.</p>
              <p>''We found that electronic mail dramatically improved the way in which we communicated,'' said William Wellman, assistant vice president for administrative affairs at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. ''It took off and permeated our organization.''</p>
              <p>But some people still wonder whether electronic mail will ever become as universal as the fax machine. Last summer John McCarthy, a Stanford University computer scientist who was a pioneer in the artificial intelligence community, took the computer industry to task for designing electronic mail that, he said, is difficult to use.</p>
              <p>''The reason why telefax will supplant e-mail, unless e-mail is separated from special networks, is that telefax works by using the existing telephone network directly,'' he wrote in a widely circulated critique. Support Services</p>
              <p>Others respond that new services becoming available through electronic mail will far outweigh the convenience of fax in the future. Compuserve Inc., an electronic information service, is now exploring the idea of selling information automatically in response to an electronic-mail request. Several other commercial ventures are also starting to help computer users wade through the avalanche of electronic data now available.</p>
              <p>For example, Anterior Technology, a Menlo Park, Calif., start-up company, is setting up a filtering service to provide subscribers with summaries of material culled from the worldwide Usenet computer network.</p>
              <p>''It's a matter of separating the gems and precious metals from the raw muck,'' said Geoff Goodfellow, Anterior's founder.</p>
