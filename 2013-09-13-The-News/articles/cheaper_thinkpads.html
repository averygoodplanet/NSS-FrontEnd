        <h2>Cheaper Thinkpads Still Classy</h2>
        <h3>by Peter H. Lewis on <date>October 22, 1998</date></h3>
        <p>After spending nearly two years interviewing consumers about their computing desires and habits, I.B.M. has created a very impressive new line of notebooks designed for people who spend their own money on computers.</p>
        <p>Best known for selling hardware to the expense-account crowd, International Business Machines has learned that individual consumers have different desires than corporate customers. Consumers, I.B.M. discovered, wanted a high-quality notebook not so much as a traveling companion but as a substitute for a desktop computer at home. And by the way, it had to cost less than $2,500.</p>
        <p>I.B.M.'s response is a trio of Thinkpad notebooks -- called the i Series -- that will have base prices of $1,499, $1,999 and $2,499 when they arrive in stores next month.</p>
        <p>I've been testing the momma-bear version, the $1,999 Thinkpad 1450. It is about twice the size of the older Thinkpad 560X, the slim four-pound model that I carry on business trips, but it is also half the cost, and it outperforms the smaller machine. For a desktop substitute, the added heft is actually an advantage. (But when I carry the external disk drive, CD-ROM drive, AC power adapters, port replicator and other attachments, the 560X actually weighs eight pounds, slightly more than the Thinkpad 1450.)</p>
        <p>The new Thinkpad has a big, bright display that outshines anything offered by competitors in the price range, respectable performance from its 266-megahertz Pentium MMX processor and lots of features that make it more friendly to consumers.</p>
        <p>The new Thinkpads arrive in what has already been a delightful season for portable PC's. Earlier this year, a resurgent Apple Computer Corporation introduced the impressive line of powerful G3 Powerbooks. Dell Computer offered a high-end Inspiron notebook featuring a Texas-sized 15-inch active-matrix display. Sony broke new ground with a powerful yet super-skinny sub-notebook computer, its magnesium-hulled Vaio 505. And we are just beginning to see a new crop of ultraportable computers that weigh a couple of pounds and cost less than $1,000.</p>
        <p>Either because of price or features, however, none of these computers seemed ideal for consumers who wanted an all-in-one portable PC that could serve as a replacement for a desktop computer at a reasonable price. (An all-in-one portable includes a floppy drive and a CD-ROM drive in the main body along with the hard disk, instead of forcing them onto the desktop as tethered external devices, octopus style.)</p>
        <p>Two years ago, prices for Pentium-class notebooks with active-matrix thin-film transistor color displays -- the best in terms of brightness and sharpness -- were above $5,000. Expense-account customers quickly made Thinkpads the most desired Windows notebooks in the airlines' first-class sections.</p>
        <p>But when it came to buying a computer for personal use, even corporate executives had to think twice about Thinkpads. With prices for desktop computers dropping every week, in some cases below $1,000, it did not take a chief financial officer to figure out that one could buy two, three or more desktop computers for the price of one high-end Thinkpad.</p>
        <p>The i-Series Thinkpads narrow the price gap between desktop and portable computers.</p>
        <p>The one I've been using has the characteristic solid feel and finish of a Thinkpad. In performance, it is still at least two generations behind comparably priced Windows-based desktop machines, but it holds its own with other laptop competitors in its class. It wins hands down for cachet.</p>
        <p>''When I get on a plane, it's still a status symbol to pull out a big black I.B.M. computer,'' said Andrew M. Seybold, editor in chief of Andrew Seybold's Outlook, a newsletter about mobile and wireless technologies. He forecasts success for the lower-cost i-Series Thinkpads. ''It's like when BMW or Mercedes came out with lower-priced models,'' he said. ''People are waiting to buy them when you drop the price.''</p>
        <p>There are three new i-Series Thinkpads. The least expensive is the model 1410, which comes with an Intel Pentium MMX processor humming at 266 megahertz, 32 megabytes of system memory, a 3.2-gigabyte hard disk, a 20-speed CD-ROM drive and a 12.1-inch thin-film transistor screen. The cost is $1,499.</p>
        <p>The model 1450, which I tested, will have an estimated street price of $1,999. It also had a 266-megahertz Intel Pentium MMX processor, but it came with 64 megabytes of RAM, a 4.3-gigabyte hard disk and a 13.3-inch screen that was exceptionally good.</p>
        <p>The poppa bear is the 1710 model, which steps up to a more powerful Intel Pentium II processor, a 24X CD-ROM drive and an extra bay that allows the use of a second battery or some sort of removable data storage. Based on specifications alone, the 1710 model appears to make the most sense as a desktop replacement, worth the extra money.</p>
        <p>The new consumer notebooks share several new features, including at least 2 megabytes of video memory and a 56K modem. Most impressive is that they all have thin-film transistor displays, which yield brighter and sharper images than the lower-cost passive displays found most often on low-cost portables.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. said it had decided to use the costlier but superior displays as a result of ''exit poll'' interviews with recent notebook purchasers. The most common regret among people who had already bought notebook computers, I.B.M. found, was that they did not get a bigger or better display, despite the higher cost.</p>
        <p>In the category of little things that make life better, I.B.M. made the new notebooks much better suited to playing audio compact disks. Working with the audio company Altec Lansing, it created a speaker system that fits in the left and right margins of the computer's display, creating a wider than normal notebook with a bit of an overbite on the lid. Other laptops, like the Compaq Presarios, sometimes place the speakers where they can be muffled by the palms of the user.</p>
        <p>The i-Series Thinkpads have the CD controls -- including a liquid-crystal display, a volume control dial, forward and reverse track selection, and eject buttons -- on the outside of the computer, so a person can play music disks without booting up. For those who resist headphones and think that their mission in life is to share their musical taste with the folks in adjoining seats, the speakers in the lid are cleverly positioned to pump out decibels to either side when the case is closed.</p>
        <p>There are cheaper alternatives if a consumer simply wants a portable audio CD player, of course.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. also clearly listened to people who wanted to become productive with their laptops without having to get a degree in computer science. The company's research revealed a list of questions that new users often have, including such common stumpers as these: How do I send a fax from my computer? How do I send and receive electronic mail? How do I download files from the Internet? What the heck is power management, and how do I do it? How do I write a letter or make a business presentation?</p>
        <p>So I.B.M. has answered the questions by creating shortcut instructions for each task (available on the 1410 and 1450 models). I.B.M. also added four color-coded function keys to the keyboard that can be set up to perform common tasks like connecting to the Internet (the computer comes with an offer of 100 free hours of Internet time through American Online), gathering E-mail and so on.</p>
        <p>What don't I like? It seems a shame not to show off such beautiful screens with a DVD drive, which would let travelers watch movies as well as play audio CD's. An external DVD add-on is the only option. The new Thinkpads are too big to use on airline seat-back trays. The Pentium MMX processor poses a dilemma for students: it keeps the cost down and is fine for E-mail, Web browsing and term papers, but it is a lousy chip for serious game players.</p>
        <p>But the bottom line is that the i-Series Thinkpads are a good value, and the only question is whether I.B.M. can produce them fast enough.</p>
