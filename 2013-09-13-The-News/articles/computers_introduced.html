              <h2>Computers Introduced At A.T.&T.</h2>

              The American Telephone and Telegraph Company yesterday introduced a desktop computer and a minicomputer that offer significant advances in technology at a competitive price.

              The introductions promise to lift the company's sagging credibility in the computer business, analysts said.
              <p>
              A.T.&T. said that its desktop computer, which is based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor, could run programs that use both the Unix operating system, developed by A.T.&T., and MS-DOS, the operating system created by the Microsoft Corporation and used by the International Business Machines Corporation. First Fully to Use 80386 Chip

              <p>
              By running both MS-DOS and Unix at the same time, the A.T.&T. machine is the first computer to make full use of the 80386 chip, the most powerful microprocessor in the PC market. Other computer companies have introduced 80386-based machines, but none has the capability of A.T.&T.'s computer.

              In separate announcements, the Unisys Corporation introduced three mid-range computers designed to compete with similar machines made by I.B.M. and the Digital Equipment Corporation, while the Hyundai Group of South Korea said that it would market computers under its own name.
