              <h2>PERSONAL COMPUTERS: Compaq Does It Again</h2>
              <h3>by Peter H. Lewis on <date> October 17, 1989 </date></h3>
              <p>EVERY once in a while a new computer comes along that leaps ahead of other machines in its class. This time, once again, it comes from the Compaq Computer Corporation. The company yesterday introduced two new notebook computers, the LTE and the LTE/286, which are the first to combine desktop computer performance in a lightweight package that can be slipped into a briefcase. For the consumer, the new Compaqs mean that computing on the road becomes an almost effortless extension of computing in an office.</p>
              <p>The new Compaqs offer the user all the advantages of the battery-powered notebooks from NEC and Zenith, including light weight, small size, bright screen and the ability to run most common software applications. The breakthrough is that unlike those earlier notebooks, the LTE computers do not compromise on important features like microprocessor power, hard disk capability, screen size or diskette compatibility.</p>
              <p>These 6.2-pound computers, smaller than a two-inch stack of typing paper, match the performance of many laptops that are twice as heavy and three times as bulky. In fact, the high-end LTE/286 rivals most desktop systems in most performance categories. No other notebook computer has offered conventional floppy or hard disk drives, or the 80286 microprocessor.</p>
              <p>On the outside the LTE and the LTE/286 are virtually identical. Both come with 640 kilobytes of system memory and a single 1.44-megabyte, 3.5-inch diskette drive as standard equipment.</p>
              <p>The Compaq LTE uses a fast 80C86 microprocessor, roughly equivalent in power to an I.B.M. PC-XT. Its base list price is $2,399. The LTE Model 20, which includes a 20-megabyte hard disk, has a list price of $2,999. The hard disk adds half a pound to the system weight, making it 6.9 pounds.</p>
              <p>The LTE/286, as the name implies, uses the more powerful AT-class 80286 chip. Its base price is $3,899. The LTE/286 Model 20, with a 20MB hard disk, costs $4,499; the Model 40, with a 40-megabyte drive, lists for $4,999.</p>
              <p>The first notebook computer was the NEC Ultralite, a 4.4-pound wonder that was introduced a year ago. The second was the Zenith Minisport, which weighs 5.9 pounds. Both achieved their compact size at the expense of performance and convenience. The new Compaqs also make some compromises, but many fewer.</p>
              <p>Compaq chose not to compromise on diskette and hard drives in the LTE's, and the decision is clearly a big advantage. When the Ultralite made its debut with a unique silicon hard disk and no floppy disk, there was no alternative. The Minisport improved on the Ultralite by offering a two-inch diskette, which allowed easier transfer of software and data than with the Ultralite. But two-inch disks are rare and expensive, and nobody else has jumped on that bandwagon.</p>
              <p>Now that Compaq has a tiny 3.5-inch conventional drive, the Zenith's two-inch format and the NEC's unusual system of storing software on credit-card-sized memory cards have much less appeal. Perhaps the pioneers will be able to adopt the larger but superior industry standard; if so, the customer will be well served. The 3.5-inch drive means the LTE can use the same diskettes as any desktop PC equipped with a 3.5-inch drive, and the user can take software out of the box and run it without going through bizarre conversion rituals.</p>
              <p>Speaking of 3.5, Compaq asserts that the LTE's will run 3.5 hours on a single battery charge. An extra battery costs $129 and weighs one and a half pounds.</p>
              <p>Compaq offers a 2,400-baud internal modem the size of a credit card as a $449 option. And speaking of credit cards, the random access memory of the LTE/286 can be expanded to two megabytes for $1,299.</p>
