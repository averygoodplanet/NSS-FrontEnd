              <h2>Apple's iMac Led Quarter Computer Sales</h2>
              <h3>by NYTimes on <date> January 22, 1999 </date></h3>
              <p>Apple Computer Inc.'s popular iMac desktop computer was the No. 1 selling machine through retail and mail-order channels in the 1998 holiday season, according to the research company PC Data.</p>
              <p>In overall sales, the iMac fell from the top spot in November to No. 3 in December. It is still the top-selling computer since its mid-August introduction and led overall sales in the fourth quarter, PC Data, of Reston, Va., reported.</p>
              <p>The report comes after Apple stock surged to a 52-week high last week when the company added five colors to the aquiline iMac's range.</p>
              <p>The share price then dropped on concern by a Salomon Smith Barney analyst about the pricing of the hot-selling machines. Apple stock closed yesterday at $38.8125, down $1.75.</p>
              <p>The iMac accounted for 6.2 percent of all fourth-quarter unit sales and 7.2 percent of the dollar volume, the PC Data report said. It counted the holiday season as October through December 1998.</p>
              <p>The average price for the iMac was $1,224 in the fourth quarter, according to PC Data. Apple priced the new iMac color range at $1,199. It cut the price of the original iMac to $1,049, down from an August introductory price of $1,299, and also offered a powerful if more expensive line of Power Mac G3 computers.</p>
              <p>Other best sellers in the fourth quarter were three Compaq Computer Corporation Presario PC's. Rounding out the top five was the Hewlett-Packard 6355 computer.</p>
              <p>Leading sales in December was the Compaq Presario 5170, followed by the Presario 5150.</p>
              <p>After the iMac, the eTower, from EMachines, a privately held supplier of low-cost computers, captured fourth place in December.</p>
