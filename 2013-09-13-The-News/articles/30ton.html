              <h2>30-TON 'BRAIN' EVOKES BIRTH OF COMPUTER AGE</h2>
              <h3>By MATTHEW L. WALD
 <date>February 16, 1986 </date></h3>
<p>
BOSTON, Feb. 14— When the Army decided in World War II that it needed better calculations of the trajectories of artillery shells, engineers and scientists at the University of Pennsylvania set about building a machine they called an electronic numerical integrator.
</p>
<p>
The Army, in a practice familiar today, began adding to the specifications as the project advanced. So a procurement officer added two words - ''so nobody in Government comes along and criticizes us for going beyond the original bounds'' - to make it the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. Eniac was celebrated last week as, for all practical purposes, the world's first computer.
</p>
<p>
The story was recalled by J. Presper Eckert, the surviving co-inventor of Eniac. The machine was put together in sections and does not seem to have had a birthday as such, but its existence was disclosed on Feb. 13, 1946. Dr. Eckert, who was 24 years old when he started work on the project in 1943 with John W. Mauchly, joined about 300 people who gathered Thursday to celebrate the anniversary at the Computer Museum, a four-year-old nonprofit institution here. Accounts of 'Mechanical Brain'
</p>
<p>
Dr. Eckert brought along 1946 newspaper accounts: ''Mechanical Brain Enlarges Man's Horizons'' was the headline in The Philadelphia Inquirer. ''Calculator Puts Humans to Shame,'' was The Cleveland Plain Dealer's, with the subheading, ''Army's Robot Is What the Schoolboy Ordered.'' The article called it all ''a new epoch in the scope of human thought.''
</p>
<p>
Eniac was built at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Engineering, in Philadelphia, at a cost of about $400,000, and later moved to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. It is widely regarded as the first large-scale, general-purpose, vacuum-tube digital computer. Dr. Eckert went on to help develop what is considered the first such computer for commercial use, Univac, which was delivered to the Bureau of the Census in 1951.
</p>
<p>
Eniac was impressive: 80 feet long and 8 feet high, weighing 30 tons, with 18,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and 1,500 relays. It had a memory capacity of 20 words and was programmed by setting 6,000 dials and switches, a task that took a crew of workers many hours.
</p>
<p>
The reliability of vacuum tubes was thought to be a problem because they were persistently failing in smaller devices like radios. The Eniac designers discovered that by slightly reducing the voltage, they could lengthen the tubes' lives. Mouse Tests and Flashing Lights
</p>
<p>
The designers also worried about interruptions of all kinds, Dr. Eckert said; they even fed samples of the wiring to hungry mice so they could pick mouse-resistant wiring.
</p>
<p>
Eniac had on its front about 4,000 red neon tubes that lit up to show the functioning of various parts. If something went wrong, Dr. Eckert said, the calculation could be rerun at extremely slow speed so the operator could use the lights to find the flaw. ''Every science fiction machine since then has had flashing lights all over it,'' Dr. Eckert said.
</p>
<p>
The machine was cut up 10 years after it was developed, and part was on display here this week, next to a cake whose icing spelled Eniac. Other parts are at the Smithsonian Institution and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
When Eniac was built, Philadelphia was the electronics capital of the world, according to Dr. Eckert. He suggested that Boston had edged out Philadelphia because the manufacturing here, primarily textiles and knitting mills, had gone sour sooner than the heavy industry of Pennsylvania had. A Computer as 'Like a Book'
</p>
<p>
A typical desktop computer today is 10 to 100 times faster than Eniac, Dr. Eckert said. But, he said, even in 1946 it was evident that a device that could perform in moments what would take mathematicians weeks would have broad impact.
</p>
<p>
''I thought of a computer as being like a book, like a library, with universal appeal,'' he said. ''But I didn't think we'd get them down in cost, or up in speed, as fast as we did. I don't think anybody did.'' That change, he said, required the next major step, the switch from the vacuum tube to the microchip. Still bigger changes lie ahead with ever more powerful chips, he said.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Eckert and Mr. Mauchly left the university to found their own computer company, which through a series of sales and mergers became part of the Sperry Corporation, where he is still a consultant.
</p>
<p>
People who came to the Eniac's birthday celebration got a chance to see the Computer Museum's displays explaining each step in the history of the technology. Other exhibits show how the machines are now manufactured and used in industry, medicine, education, artificial intelligence, the arts and business.
</p>
<p>
The audience heard Dr. Eckert describe how he spent many hours restoring a Hammond organ built in the late 1930's that used 91 vacuum tubes, and was, he said, the first music synthesizer.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Eckert, according to his wife, Judith, likes to tinker with audio speakers in their home in Blue Bell, Pa. There is no computer in the house.
