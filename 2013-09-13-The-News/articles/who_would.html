              <h2>The Executive Computer; Who Would Buy Machines Without Disk Drives?</h2>
              <h3>by Peter H. Lewis on <date> June 3, 1990 </date></h3>
              <p>The Houston-based Compaq Computer Corporation is best known for its powerful desktop and floor-standing PC's. These are used by many businesses as ''servers'' for clusters of less-powerful machines connected on local area networks. In such a setup, one fast server with a large amount of hard disk storage is the repository of most, or all, files needed by a group of workers. Each worker on the network pulls the needed information from the server, processes it at a desktop computer - which in most cases does not need to be very fancy - then returns the files to the central server.</p>
              <p>Competition in the server market has become intense, and last month Compaq broadened its attention to the work-station end of the network, where prices are lower but volumes are higher. Millions of PC's are added to networks each year, and Compaq introduced two models designed specifically for use as network work stations: the Deskpro 386N, which has a base price of $2,299, and the Deskpro 286N, which starts at $1,699. The 386N is built around the Intel Corporation's 80386SX microprocessor, running at 16 megahertz; the 286N uses the 12-MHz 80286 chip. Both systems come with one megabyte of random access memory.</p>
              <p>Unlike conventional personal computers, which typically have a floppy disk drive for moving programs in and out of the machine and a hard disk drive for storing data, the new Compaq models are diskless. That's because disk drives are superfluous when all the files and application software are stored in the server. Of course, the machine would be useless, except as a paperweight, if it were disconnected from the network. On the other hand, diskless work stations give corporations enormous control over the flow of information and are especially attractive to companies concerned about contamination by viruses, other tampering or theft of data.</p>
              <p>But because drives come in handy sometimes, and because business computer system operators frequently want the flexibility to move machines around the office to meet different needs, Compaq offers a $100 floppy disk and an $800, 40-megabyte hard disk as options on the 386N and 286N.</p>
              <p>Although the new machines mark Compaq's entry into diskless work stations, other companies, including the International Business Machines Corporation, already offer diskless PC's. Still others have said they will introduce them soon. I.B.M. has been selling diskless versions of its PS/2 machines to large customers for some time. Next, according to PC Week, a magazine that covers the personal computer industry, I.B.M. will market a diskless work station based on the Intel 80386SX microprocessor for about $2,000, starting this fall.</p>
              <p>Users ''don't want to pay for features they don't need,'' Compaq said in announcing its new machines. But why buy a diskless PC when it costs only $100 to add a floppy drive? The drive is important if the PC is ever to be used as a standalone, and $100 seems a small price to pay for that flexibility. Perhaps the more important consideration is network security. If there is no disk drive, the average worker cannot unintentionally introduce a computer virus or worm into the system. Viruses are small chunks of rogue computer code that saboteurs hide in otherwise innocent programs, and once they are introduced into the system, they spread from machine to machine and cause damage. A worker who brings an infected program from home - perhaps a game program to play on breaks - and loads it into the network can wipe out the entire system.</p>
